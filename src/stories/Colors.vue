        For colors I use Ï† as well. But primarilly the objective is to reduce blue on the
        background.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I am thinking the color base being white at (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) I would do something like (R
        + G) : B would be Ï†. But that turned out to be too yellowish for me. So I made a generalized
        function for it which takes in powers of Ï†.

      <p>Some swatches</p>
      <div class="swatch-box">
        <div
          v-for="a in [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]"
          class="swatch"
          :class="{ [`swatch--background-${a}`]: true }"
        >
          <span class="text-xs">{{ `background${a}` }}</span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Interesting negative powers have no effect. In the end I chose a power of 5. Why 5? it's not
        too yellow but it's also not too white. It gives a warmer feel but for my eyes. Again this
        is opinionated to what I want so don't try to derive much into it. I do like the fact that
        it is a prime number, one of the factors in the Ï† computation and it's a midpoint between 0
        to 9.

      <p>
        I am intentionally not doing the CSS naming of colors for now. I am thinking that we simply
        specify base palette colors and apply functions on top of it. Plus it looks weird when I see
        it in NativeBase and Tailwind.
      </p>

      <p>As for color areas, the following will be defined.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>background</li>
        <li>
          background--darker, this is for scenarios where we want to have cards... which BTW I am
          thinking of avoiding. They take up too much screen real estate, but may be okay for
          desktop that has more space but on mobile and tablet I find it just takes too much space
          for little benefit.
        </li>
        <li>
          text, well this will either black or white depending on dark or light mode. Also my
          experiment would be to avoid drawing too much attention to the controls because generally
          I want the focus to be on the fields rather than the buttons. Then again the placement of
          the submit buttons may be changed so it's in a fixed spot like the good old UI days
          because they really shouldn't be part of the form proper. Like I am thinking of having an
          action area on desktop devices it will be at the bottom on mobile it will be on the top
          (or maybe both at the bottom just to defy iOS standards). Also I don't intend to follow
          any existing conventions anyway, this is an opinionated experiment afterall.
        </li>
        <li>
          link. debating on this one should I have hover, visited, focused etc? I guess for general
          consistency with the rest of the planet I would use a blue tone. But I don't think I'll
          underline. Since it's blueish I guess this would also be "primary" or "default" action. I
          am still going to make buttons look like buttons, I didn't like the iOS making them look
          no better than text with a different color and relying on placement alone.
        </li>
        <li>danger. this would be a redish tone color indicating a dangerous operation</li>
      </ul>

        For dark mode it's the same thing as light mode where I use Ï† as well. Same objective is to
        reduce blue on the background. Anyway I am thinking of capping the power computations to 9
        and make 10 === infinity. Primarily so things line up in monospace font.
      </p>
      <p>However when I did it to reduce the blue the color ended up looking like ðŸ’©.</p>

      <p>
        So rather than using the all or nothing color value I decided to use 7 which is the next
        prime number after 5 because I like primes as much as I like phi. I then applied it to the
        light mode and it actually turns out better in that it's less straining on the eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        So overall it looks like my color choices make things look more warm and earthy. ðŸ™„ but for
        the light background color, it reminds me of the folders we had when I was a kid and the
        dark mode background well reminds me of poop still, but a little less I guess I can say it
        looks like soil.
