# Welcome to Storybook

This is an opinionated component library primarily for my own website and to test out ideas.

## Normalize vs CSS reset

I opted for normalize with [normalize-css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to offload the work of writing my own reset with something that is regularly updated.

I also opted *not* to use Tailwind CSS to make it easier for me to port this later to React Native.

## rem vs px 

`rem`.  Even if I am used to `px` for most things at work, I decided to use `rem` as it allows me to set a **root** size that would be responsive and scale everything relative to that number.  That way I don't have to adjust the font sizes across different devices on each component, I only need to do it based on the root.

This differs from

# Organization

* Typography
* Color ??
* Components
* Blocks
* Page Blocks
* Pages

## Typography
This is the lowest level of the organization.  At this level I specify the font sizes, line heights in `rem` units.  Spacing is in `px` (for now until I confirm).

Only the root fonts is responsive.

Due to how vue works, the normalization and the root font size need to be globally defined.

`<h1>..<h6>` would not be styled by tag, it needs to be explicity set with a class.  

I use golden ratios everywhere for fun.

## Components

Components - inline components. I kept the same terminology as Vuetify and Primevue.  These represent components that are `inline` or `inline-flex`.  They are ment to be usable within a body of text.

## Blocks

These are meant to group components together and sometimes other blocks.  These are expected to take the full width of their container.

These are not meant to be responsive but may do so.

They're one of block, flex or grid.

## Page blocks

These take up the whole width of the page.  These are meant to be responsive and **only** provide the edge padding/margins for the content.

This is `block` or `flex`.  It shouldn't be `grid`.

## Pages

These define the structure of the page itself.  

Pages may contain the HTML5 structural tags such as main, nav, aside.

It consists of page blocks stack one on top of another.

Background imagery is done at this level.

We recommend building UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.
